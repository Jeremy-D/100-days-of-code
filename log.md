# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 26: 06/20/19

**Today's Progress**: Missed a day
**Thoughts:** I was driving all day so I feel like that's a good excuse.
**topics** none
**hours** 0

_________________________________________________________________
### Day 25: 06/19/19

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an interview cake problem
**Thoughts:** I worked on the Shuffle an Array in place problem. It was kind of hard to think clearly so I wasn't able to solve it with code although I think my solution was correct. I need to go back and implement it and see how I can implement it better.

I need to keep an algos directory somewhere so I can look at it for reference.

**topics** algos
**hours** 1.5

_________________________________________________________________

### Day 24: 06/18/19

**Today's Progress**: Continue Schema design and app design for Map Notes app.
**Thoughts:** I'm remembering more about SQL and tables that can connect other tables. I still need to figure out the best way to add permissions to different maps in my design.

I didn't write any code today but I drew out some of the business logic for the app in my notebook and it feels good to have a better understanding of how all of these front end/back end technologies work together. 

I need to tweet more for the 100 days of code challenge

**topics** SQL, SchemaDesign, axios, Redux 
**hours** 2

_________________________________________________________________
 
### Day 23: 06/17/19

**Today's Progress**: Start Schema design for Map Notes app.
**Thoughts:** My SQL/Schema design skills are a little rusty. I couldn't remember how to create associations between tables.

**topics** SQL
**hours** 1

_________________________________________________________________
 
### Day 22: 06/16/19

**Today's Progress**: Learn about React context API. Finish react-redux course(for now)
**Thoughts:** The context API is fine but it still seems like redux is the way to go for complex React projects.


**topics** React, ContextAPI
**hours** 2.5

_________________________________________________________________

### Day 21: 06/15/19

**Today's Progress**: Work on modal for React app
**Thoughts:** Use url based selection(not a selection reducer) when possible. In react we do this with BrowserRouter. 

A PUT req replaces all of the properties of a record whereas a PATCH req updates some properties of a record. Make sure to use the right one in your CRUD apps!

Use portals (React.createPortal) for modals. This changes the parent element of the component so that a modal is possible. Use React.Fragment and event.stopPropagation() with modals.

### Day 19: 06/11/19

**Today's Progress**: Work on more Redux Form stuff
**Thoughts:** Programmatic navigation is the word used to describe forced navigation of a user. For example, when a user fills out a form, we use a Router history object to push them back to the home page.

### Day 18: 06/11/19

**Today's Progress**: Work on redux form
**Thoughts:** Redux form makes life easier because we only have to set up a couple of things(setting input value, onChange function) instead of doing all the redux stuff.

**Today's Progress**: Get Through more of the grider tutorial.

### Day 17: 06/09/19

**Today's Progress**: Make api calls with Redux Thunk
**Thoughts:** Redux Thunk is a little complicated but understanding it definitely forces you to understand redux better. It also lets you do async api calls which is the fun part anyway.

### Day 16: 06/08/19

**Today's Progress**: Begin to implement React front end
**Thoughts:** I neede to get better at always handling errors and also testing in general. Always use preventDefault() in event handlers. You can use arrow functions to bind event handlers or `this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)`.

**Today's Progress**: fullstack react

**Thoughts:** Webhooks are still kind of confusing but I'm getting a better hang of things/

**topics** mongoDB, express, node

_________________________________________________________________

### Day 11: 06/03/19

**Today's Progress**: Worked on helloGov app

**Thoughts:** Studying the MERN stack makes it easier to approach other apps built in js environments, but I still need to learn a little bit more about express/mongo. The helloGov app is built on angularJS(angular 1) and once I understand the backend a little better I think I'll actually be able to contribute more to the project.

Also it's really hard to work on projects at meetups.

### Day 10: 06/02/19

**Today's Progress**: Finished the redux-form section of fullstack react course

**Thoughts:** Redux was confusing at first but not too bad once you get used to it. I think I should read through the redux docs/code.

### Day 9: 06/01/19

**Today's Progress**: Got a lot done on the fullstack react course! Finished sendgrid and stripe payment integrations.

**Thoughts:** It's kind of a pain going through this whole course when I just want to get started on my next project, but I think it's worth it in the long run. It's definitely cool to see the differences between rails/express and how things are done differently in a JS environment. I think I'm going to use PostgreSQL on my project. Still not sure why mongo is so popular. 

PS going to add topics and time subtitle to journal entries so I can do some analytics on my 100 days of code studying. Hopefully it's not too difficult to parse an md file but I'll look that up later.

### Day 8: 5/31/19

**Today's Progress**: Didn't program today but did some pretty good work on my data analytics stuff at work

**Thoughts:** It's hard to put in extra work on Fridays


_________________________________________________________________

### Day 7: 5/30/19

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to work on the fullstack react course.

**Thoughts:** The course I'm taking is good but I feel like I need to read through the documentation on some of the libraries we're using. It feels like I have a surface level knowledge of mongo/mongoose, express, passport etc but I'd like to know how they work in a more in depth way.

Didn't quite get an hour in today, but I'm doing a lot of database work at work so I'll cut myself some slack.

Can't wait to have more time this weekend to program more!

### Day 6: 5/29/19

**Today's Progress**: Made some progess on integrating the Stripe API into the tutorial project

**Thoughts:** It's hard to make too much meaningful progress in an hour, but I think getting that hour minimum every day(in addition to the days when I'm able to code for longer periods) really adds up in the long run!

I need to find some time to work on other stuff in addition to the tutorial project.

### Day 5: 5/28/19

**Today's Progress**: Got my hour in today! It felt so short but that's all of the time I had today. Got the stripe API keys working with the server side/front end of the emaily app.

**Thoughts:** Programing and writing about it feels good! Tomorrow I want to post on twitter and do more of the 100 days challenge. I'm definitely going to see if I can make it all the way through June.

_________________________________________________________________

### Day 5 (recap): 5/28/19

**Today's Progress**: Got through a fair amount of the fullstack react course. Added mongoDB to the project. Got the front end and back end playing together nicely. Started writing some react finally.

**Thoughts:** I'm interested to learn why mongoDB is so popular with modern javascript. I've heard it's faster with nosql data but I feel like it would be just as good in most cases to just use a sql data base. 

Either way the project is currently using two servers for the project but not completely separating out the servers into a server side API and a client side application. I think for my next project (easy songwriter) I might try to make the backend totally separate.

I had to do a bit of review when we covered some of the redux stuff but the concepts aren't that difficult right now. We will see how I do with redux when I have to use it in the wild though.

### Day 1: 5/24/19

**Today's Progress**: Got through the first part of authentication with Grider Fullstack React course.

**Thoughts:** Authentication is a fairly complex subject, but the flow seems really similar in a lot of ways to how
authentication worked with Ruby/Rails.

_________________________________________________________________


### Day 0: 5/23/19

**Today's Progress**: Started Grider Fullstack React course.

**Thoughts:** I've been coding for a while but I think learning fullstack JS over Ruby/Rails will make it easier to work on projects with other people as well as get a job in web development. I feel like at this point I know quite a bit about programming, but 100 days of code should be able to help me focus and build some cool projects! I'd like to especially focus on improving my ability to improve my ability to develop application architecture and build cool data visualizations. 

**Link to work:** N/A
