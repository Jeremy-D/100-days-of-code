# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 5/23/19

**Today's Progress**: Started Grider Fullstack React course.

**Thoughts:** I've been coding for a while but I think learning fullstack JS over Ruby/Rails will make it easier to work on projects with other people as well as get a job in web development. I feel like at this point I know quite a bit about programming, but 100 days of code should be able to help me focus and build some cool projects! I'd like to especially focus on improving my ability to improve my ability to develop application architecture and build cool data visualizations. 

**Link to work:** N/A
