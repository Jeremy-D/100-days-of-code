# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: 5/28/19

**Today's Progress**: Got my hour in today! It felt so short but that's all of the time I had today. Got the stripe API keys working with the server side/front end of the emaily app.

**Thoughts:** Programing and writing about it feels good! Tomorrow I want to post on twitter and do more of the 100 days challenge. I'm definitely going to see if I can make it all the way through June.

### Day 5 (recap): 5/28/19

**Today's Progress**: Got through a fair amount of the fullstack react course. Added mongoDB to the project. Got the front end and back end playing together nicely. Started writing some react finally.

**Thoughts:** I'm interested to learn why mongoDB is so popular with modern javascript. I've heard it's faster with nosql data but I feel like it would be just as good in most cases to just use a sql data base. 

Either way the project is currently using two servers for the project but not completely separating out the servers into a server side API and a client side application. I think for my next project (easy songwriter) I might try to make the backend totally separate.

I had to do a bit of review when we covered some of the redux stuff but the concepts aren't that difficult right now. We will see how I do with redux when I have to use it in the wild though.

### Day 1: 5/24/19

**Today's Progress**: Got through the first part of authentication with Grider Fullstack React course.

**Thoughts:** Authentication is a fairly complex subject, but the flow seems really similar in a lot of ways to how
authentication worked with Ruby/Rails.

### Day 0: 5/23/19

**Today's Progress**: Started Grider Fullstack React course.

**Thoughts:** I've been coding for a while but I think learning fullstack JS over Ruby/Rails will make it easier to work on projects with other people as well as get a job in web development. I feel like at this point I know quite a bit about programming, but 100 days of code should be able to help me focus and build some cool projects! I'd like to especially focus on improving my ability to improve my ability to develop application architecture and build cool data visualizations.
